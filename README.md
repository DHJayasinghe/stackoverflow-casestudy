# Stackoverflow Case Study

This is a case study on implementing StackOverflow core features as an REST API. Primary purpose of this case study is an learning activity on backend engineering and database tuning concerns that gonna face while implementing the solution. The [Milestone 1](https://github.com/DHJayasinghe/stackoverflow-casestudy/milestone/1) is to cover 4 core features of StackOverflow as while documenting below concerns.

1. What are the problems faced or problems that could face?
2. What are the solutions available for these problems?
3. Why pick certain solution over other for that particular problem?

### Rules on Completing the features
1. Each feature should contains a descriptive information about the feature after analyzing original stackoverflow site. Only the basic functionalities required.
1. Each feature should include **at least one technical concern** on implementing the feature.
2. Those technical concerns must have **more than 1 solutions** as findings. Findings must have references links to support from trusted resources. 
3. All technical concerns and solutions must backed by a test case (Unit Testing/Integration Testing). Which describes the analysis.
4. All test cases must be well documented in-order to run by someother developer without help.

### Core features that gonna cover

1. Question Search Bar
2. Question Filters
3. Question/Answers Page
4. Voting Option

### Technologies that gonna use

1. ASP.NET CORE 6.0 Minimal APIs
2. C#
3. Docker
4. SQL Server 2022
5. Dapper ORM

### Development Setup
1. Download StackOverflow Data Dump - 10GB after Extract [1GB download size](https://downloads.brentozar.com/StackOverflow2010.7z)
